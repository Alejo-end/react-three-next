### :bullettrain_side: Architecture

Thanks to [tunnel-rat](https://github.com/pmndrs/tunnel-rat) the starter can portal components between separate renderers. Anything rendered inside the `<View/>` component of the starter will be rendered in the 3D Context. For better performances it uses gl.scissor to cut the viewport into segments.

```jsx
<div className='relative'>
  <View orbit className='relative sm:h-48 sm:w-full'>
    <Dog scale={2} />
    // Some 3D components will be rendered here
  </View>
</div>
```
